# Elden Ring Camera Distance Mod
Adjust camera distance by patching Elden Ring process memory  
This mod requires [EldenRingModLoader](https://github.com/techiew/EldenRingModLoader)  
## Installation
- Install EldenRingModLoader
- Clone this repository and build it using Visual Studio 2022
- Move the DLL file into the "Game/mods" directory
## Configuration
A default configuration is created when the mod is loaded for the first time. 
Refer to the config file in the mod's directory for more information.
## Credits
Thanks to ***techiew*** for *EldenRingModLoader* and "ModUtils.h"  
## TODO
- camera distance calculations are a bit wacky... may need to investigate that.
- FoV offset (it seems that Elden Ring has different FoV values dependent on who your opponent is, as seen in the Regulation.bin file)
