# Elden Ring Camera Distance Mod
Adjust camera distance by patching Elden Ring process memory  
This mod requires [EldenRingModLoader](https://github.com/techiew/EldenRingModLoader)  
## Credits
Thanks to ***techiew*** for *EldenRingModLoader* and "ModUtils.h"
## TODO
- Add support for a config file
- FoV offset (it seems that Elden Ring has different FoV values dependent on who your opponent is, as seen in the Regulation.bin file)
